# USAGE:
# Checks kraken2 report and extracts those files in the reference that respond to the species (S) taxids.
# 
# INPUTS:
# - 1: kraken report
# - 2: tsv file containing the filename and the asssociated taxid
# - 3: directory containing the reference mentioned in input 2

#    NOTE: this file must refer to files given to the corresponding reference directory, and
#    can be automatically generated in the scripts given by nf-core/pikavirus. Otherwise, the 
#    file schema MUST be:
#
#    *headers not necessary*
#    col0: Assembly_accession
#    col1: Species_taxid
#    col2: Subspecies_taxid (= to Species_taxid if not a subspecies)
#    col3: Scientific_name
#    col4: Intraespecific_name
#    col5: Download_URL
#    col6: File_name
#
#   This schema is temporal, and will probably be updated to be less-restrictive requirement in 
#   future releases. Don't worry, we are actively working on it!
#
# DISCLAIMER: this script has exclusively been developed for the correct functioning of nf-core pikavirus,
# and therefore is not guaranteed to function properly in other settings. Despite this, feel free to use it
# at will.
