# USAGE:
# Checks MASH result, extracts the name of the significative references found in the given directory,
# and creates a symlink for nextflow to pick for future references.
# 
# INPUTS:
# - 1: MASH file result (tsv format, obtained from mash dist)
# - 2: path to directory containing the reference data
#

# DISCLAIMER: this script has exclusively been developed for the correct functioning of nf-core pikavirus,
